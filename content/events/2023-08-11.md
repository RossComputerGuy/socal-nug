# Welcome to the Southern California Nix Users Group

We're a vibrant community centered around the Nix ecosystem. This group is for you if you're an experienced Nix developer, a Linux enthusiast, or someone who loves learning about cutting-edge technology!

Our meetups are a forum for sharing knowledge, discussing challenges, and celebrating success within the world of Nix. We delve into topics such as package management, reproducible builds, and more.

Each meetup features a presentation about a particular aspect of Nix, like advanced techniques, an introduction for beginners, or a real-world use case walkthrough.
